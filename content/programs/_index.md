Here are some programs I have worked on in the past:
- [**Zipcall (2020)**](https://zipcall.io/) - A peer-to-peer browser video calling platform with unmatched video quality
and latency. It has 2.8k stars on GitHub and boasts 100k active users. I contributed by adding support for group
calling.
- [**Kafka NLP (2020)**](https://github.com/questo-ai/Kafka "Kafka NLP") - An NLP framework for iOS that includes POS
tagging and Dependency Parsing, implemented using CoreML.
- [**Questo AI (2016-2019)**](https://questo.ai/) - An AI study assistant that dynamically generates comprehension
quizzes based on textbooks and websites.
- [**Photonify (2017)**](http://getphotonify.strikingly.com/) - An iOS camera app that suggests better compositions in
real-time.
- [**Photography (2014-Present)**](https://instagra.com/taixhi)
- [**Hequals (2017)**](https://devpost.com/software/hequals-h) - An automatic human resource allocator aiming to
eliminate any form of discrimination in the tech world by making decisions based solely on skills.

a certain location using only Google Streetview. Developed with JavaScript.
- [**RealAR**](https://devpost.com/software/au-real-time-multiplayer-ar-experience-for-ios) - I created a prototype iOS
framework for creating a shared AR environment between multiple devices using sockets. However, Apple later included a
similar feature in their ARKit for iOS12 in June.
